# Glacier
A JavaScript-like language for TI-83/84 Calculators.
Glacier is a transpiler, to convert a JavaScript-like language to Hybrid Basic (or maybe ICE). 
# Features
- Full on Arrays (that support strings),
- Functions,
- Multipurpose variables,
- Packages,
- Greater control over the calculator than TI-Basic,
- Tilemaps,
- Objects,
- and possibly more.
# Build
Clone the repo and enter it,
```
git clone https://www.github.com/DarkSystemGit/ICEScript.git
cd ./ICEScript
```
Install dependcies and build.
```
npm install && npm run build
```

# Usage
```
node ./main.js FILE
```


The project is meant to be an alternative to ICE, and was inspired by ICE in the first place.
Glacier is a work in progress, so don't expect much from it right now. I'll probably be done by February (No promises though).
